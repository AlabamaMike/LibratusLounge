### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these issues:

- Issues labeled `good first issue` - issues which should only require a few lines of code
- Issues labeled `help wanted` - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Process

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LibratusLounge.git
   cd LibratusLounge
   npm install
   ```

2. **Create a Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
   ```

3. **Make Your Changes**
   - Write code
   - Add tests
   - Update documentation

4. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   npm test
   npm run typecheck
   npm run lint
   ```

5. **Commit Your Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add amazing feature"
   ```

### Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation only changes
- `style:` Changes that don't affect code meaning
- `refactor:` Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf:` Performance improvement
- `test:` Adding missing tests
- `chore:` Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

Examples:
```
feat: add beginner agent personality
fix: correct pot odds calculation in advanced agent
docs: update API reference for decision endpoint
perf: optimize hand evaluation with lookup tables
```

### Code Style Guidelines

#### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use explicit return types for functions
- Document complex functions with JSDoc

```typescript
/**
 * Evaluates the strength of a poker hand
 * @param hand - The player's hole cards
 * @param community - The community cards
 * @returns A number between 0 and 1 representing hand strength
 */
export function evaluateHandStrength(
  hand: Card[],
  community: Card[]
): number {
  // Implementation
}
```

#### Testing

- Write unit tests for all new functions
- Use descriptive test names
- Group related tests with `describe` blocks
- Mock external dependencies

```typescript
describe('HandEvaluator', () => {
  describe('evaluateHandStrength', () => {
    it('should return 1.0 for royal flush', () => {
      const hand = [
        { rank: 'A', suit: 'h' },
        { rank: 'K', suit: 'h' }
      ];
      const community = [
        { rank: 'Q', suit: 'h' },
        { rank: 'J', suit: 'h' },
        { rank: 'T', suit: 'h' }
      ];
      
      expect(evaluateHandStrength(hand, community)).toBe(1.0);
    });
  });
});
```

### Project Structure Guidelines

When adding new features:

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ agents/           # Agent implementations
â”œâ”€â”€ strategies/       # Decision-making strategies
â”œâ”€â”€ personality/      # Personality traits and engines
â”œâ”€â”€ integration/      # External service integrations
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/           # Utility functions
â””â”€â”€ types/           # TypeScript type definitions

tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ unit/            # Unit tests (mirrors src/ structure)
â”œâ”€â”€ integration/     # Integration tests
â””â”€â”€ e2e/            # End-to-end tests
```

### Performance Considerations

- Minimize LLM calls through caching
- Use Workers KV for persistent caching
- Profile code for bottlenecks
- Consider memory constraints of Workers

### Security Guidelines

- Never commit API keys or secrets
- Validate all input data
- Use type guards for runtime validation
- Implement rate limiting
- Log security-relevant events

## Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# Run specific test file
npm test -- agents/base-agent.test.ts

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```

### Writing Tests

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and classes
2. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
3. **E2E Tests**: Test complete workflows
4. **Performance Tests**: Benchmark critical paths

### Test Coverage

We aim for:
- 90%+ coverage for utility functions
- 80%+ coverage for agent logic
- 70%+ coverage for integration code

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Include examples in complex functions
- Document edge cases and assumptions

### User Documentation

When adding features, update:
- README.md for major features
- API_REFERENCE.md for new endpoints
- QUICKSTART.md for common use cases
